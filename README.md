üåø Plant Disease Detector & Crop Recommender
This project offers an integrated solution for agriculture: AI-driven plant disease detection, environmental crop recommendations, and practical remedies. It combines a hardware system for data collection with a Streamlit web application powered by a custom U-Net model and Google's Gemini AI.

‚ú® Key Features at a Glance
Disease Detection: AI analyzes plant images for health issues.

Crop Recommendations: Suggestions based on environmental data.

Remedy Solutions: Practical advice for detected diseases.

Visual Segmentation: Highlights affected areas on images.

Hardware Integration: Real-world data input from custom sensors.

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Module
The project incorporates a custom-built hardware component that collects essential real-time environmental and soil data. This data directly informs the application's crop recommendations and remedy suggestions.

üå± Disease Detection & Remedies Flow
See how the application diagnoses plant health and offers solutions.

# Sample1:
1. Upload & Analyze 
Upload your plant image. The AI will process it for disease detection.

2. Segmented Disease & Prediction with Medicine , Precautions
The U-Net model segments the disease regions, and the AI provides a diagnosis along with confidence.
Receive detailed recommendations for remedies, including both preventative measures and suitable medicines.
(This detail will be visible in the "Output Image with Segmented Disease" if that image captures the entire output section with medicine/precautions cards. If you have a separate image for just these, add another placeholder below.)
